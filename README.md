# Kafka List Join Demo

This project shows two ways to perform a list join in a Kafka streams application. A list join refers to joining a
record that contains a list with a KTable, such that each element in the list gets joined with the corresponding element
in the KTable.

Check out `TODO: add link` for a discussion of the approaches.
